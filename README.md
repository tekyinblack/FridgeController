# FridgeController
This software is intended to provide a more sophisticated control mechanism to a 12V refridgerator. 
It is primarily aimed at a BD35 controller based refridgerator but could be adapted to many other models.
It offers input temperature sensing over one-wire, and outputs control to internal and external fans
for cooling and internal air circulation, as well as the core compressor switching.
